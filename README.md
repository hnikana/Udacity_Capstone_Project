# Udacity_Capstone_Project
Capstone Project
Predictiong the Bitcoin values, with both Stack LSTM: [Udacity-Capstone-StackLSTM.ipynb](Udacity-Capstone-StackLSTM.ipynb)
and Seq2Seq model: [Udacity-Capstone-seq2seq-final.ipynb](Udacity-Capstone-seq2seq-final.ipynb). 

## Resources

* [Seq2Seq Model](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction) - Helpful Github notebook for creating Seq2Seq model for time series prediction with Bitcoin data values.
* [Seq2Seq model with keras](https://github.com/LukeTonin/keras-seq-2-seq-signal-prediction) - Github's notebook for time series prediction with keras library.
